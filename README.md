In this project, we aim to enhance the monitoring and analysis capabilities of Spring Boot applications by integrating them with Splunk. By leveraging Splunk's real-time data ingestion and analytics features, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior and performance of our applications through log analysis.

Key Features:
Log Ingestion: Configure Spring Boot applications to send logs to Splunk in real-time.

Dashboard Creation: Develop custom dashboards in Splunk to visualize and analyze log data effectively.

Alerting: Set up alerts in Splunk to notify stakeholders about critical events or anomalies in the application logs.

Technologies Used:

Spring Boot: For building and running the Java-based Spring applications.
Splunk: For real-time log analysis and visualization.
Log4j2: For logging within the Spring Boot applications.
Maven: For project management and dependency resolution.

Outcomes
Improved monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities for Spring Boot applications.
Real-time visibility into application performance and user behavior.
Enhanced proactive incident management through Splunk's alerting features.
Streamlined development and deployment processes with automated log analysis.
